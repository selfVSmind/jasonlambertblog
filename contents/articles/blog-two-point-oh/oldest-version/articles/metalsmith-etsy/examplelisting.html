    &lt;p&gt;This is an instantly downloadable sticker sheet! It comes in several formats (PNG, PDF, and JPEG) and you can print it out on sticker paper using a standard printer. I designed this sheet with the Silhouette Cameo cutting machine in mind but you can use scissors or even a round punch to cut them out. Perfect for planners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three versions are included! One with 4 columns of stickers, one with 5 and one with 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is designed for printing on a full page sticker sheet measuring 8.5x11 inches. My sticker sheets come in a very large resolution (2550x3300 pixels) so your prints will come out crisp every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After purchasing, you are free to print as many times as you wish for any purpose it won&amp;#39;t bother me. Just please do not redistribute the digital files. Please rate and comment and favorite and all of that good stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
