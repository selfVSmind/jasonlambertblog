I'd be a lunatic not to accompany my updated blog with a fresh post.
There's a brand new landing page as well. I'm very happy with the results so far.

Instead of adding a bunch of images here, I've gone ahead and archived an old build of this blog for you to compare first hand.

### Before And After

<span class="more"></span>

You are already viewing the after so here is a link to <a href="old-version" target="_blank">the before</a> (opens a new tab).

### What Did I Do?

- I've rewritten the CSS file from scratch!
- I reworked the main page to include project cards.
- Added some animations and Neumorphic design elements.
- Added social links at bottom of every page.

### What Did I Learn?

- I've been evading a proper CSS eduaction for **years**. I feel I have a much stronger grasp on things now.
- I need to stop being so stubborn.
- [Neumorphic](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/neumorphism-ui/) design!
- Did I mention CSS?
- Oh! Some good sounding layout advice from a YouTube video I watched this morning: have something big, something medium, and something small.
